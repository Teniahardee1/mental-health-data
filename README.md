# County Health Data Repository
This is a repository derived from the County Public Health Data Set provided above. This Data set contains stats on public health in United States counties from 2014-2015.

The purpose of this repository is to provide information on mental healthcare statistics in North Carolina counties. The data examined focuses on the stats of "Mental health providers" and "Poor mental health days". The data set allows for the comparison of mental health support across these counties and can be a source to narrow down differences and allocate resources where seen as needed. 
## Getting Started
There are two .csv files located above. One being the original data set labeled as CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv and the other being the refined set labeled as refindeddata.csv.
